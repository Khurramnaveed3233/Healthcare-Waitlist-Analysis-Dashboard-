![health dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab57a96c-57d4-47d9-89b3-182f9a07b2c7)


## Executive Summary  

This dashboard provides a consolidated **summary view of patient wait lists** across specialities, time bands, and age groups between **Jan 2018 ‚Äì Mar 2021**.  
It highlights both the **scale of the current backlog** and **trends in patient waiting times**, helping leadership identify pressure points and opportunities for operational improvement.  

---

## Key Insights  

### 1. Overall Wait List Size  
- **Latest Month Wait List:** **22M**  
- **Previous Year‚Äôs Latest Month Wait List:** **1M**  

This indicates a **dramatic surge in patient backlogs** compared to the previous year. Likely drivers could be: 

- Pandemic-related delays in elective procedures  
- Resource constraints (staff, equipment, beds)  
- Prioritization of emergency over routine cases  

---

### 2. Wait Times by Age and Duration

- **Longest Waits:** Patients waiting **18+ months** (118‚Äì136 average wait depending on age)  
- **Children (0‚Äì15 years):** Disproportionately high waiting times in early months (0‚Äì3 months at 96 days)  
- **Older adults (65+):** Increasing delays particularly after the 6-month mark  

**Insight:** The system struggles most at **extremes of age (children & elderly)**, raising both clinical and equity concerns.  

---

### 3. Speciality-Specific Trends  

Average/Median Wait Times by speciality:  
- üëÅ **Ophthalmology:** 36.02  
-  **Paediatric Orthopaedics:** 34.58  
- **Paediatric Respiratory Medicine:** 36.19  
- **Pain Relief:** Extended wait times also observed  

**Insight:** Consistent bottlenecks in **paediatric specialities and ophthalmology** ‚Äî areas critical for quality of life and long-term outcomes.  

---

### 4. Time Trends in Wait List Volume  
Two trend charts highlight backlog evolution:  

- **Inpatient Cases (Bottom Left):**  
  - Significant fluctuations between **2019‚Äì2020**, with sharp peaks around mid-2020  
  - Some recovery visible, but backlog persists above baseline  

- **Day Case & Inpatient Combined (Bottom Right):**  
  - **Downward trend (2018‚Äìearly 2020)**, followed by a **sharp rise mid-2020**  
  - This aligns with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when non-urgent procedures were postponed  

**Takeaway:** While some recovery is happening, the system is still **struggling to reduce wait times back to pre-pandemic levels**.  

---

##  Business & Healthcare Impact  

- **Patient Risk:** Long waits increase risk of deterioration, especially for vulnerable groups  
- **Operational Pressure:** Persistent backlog shows mismatch between **capacity and demand**  
- **Equity Concerns:** Children, older adults, and some specialities face disproportionate delays  

---

## Recommendations  

1. **Targeted Resource Allocation**  
   - Prioritize **paediatric orthopaedics, respiratory, and ophthalmology**  

2. **Age-Sensitive Strategies**  
   - Fast-track pathways for **children and elderly patients**  

3. **Capacity Planning**  
   - Use predictive models for demand forecasting  
   - Extend operating hours or introduce weekend clinics  

4. **Monitor & Communicate**  
   - Update dashboard **monthly** for tracking progress  
   - Share trends with clinical & operational teams  

---

## Key Takeaway  

The dashboard tells a clear story: **patient backlogs have surged**, largely due to systemic shocks, with **children, older adults, and specific specialities** most affected.  
By acting strategically ‚Äî **targeting resources, prioritizing vulnerable groups, and monitoring progress** ‚Äî healthcare leaders can turn these insights into impactful, patient-centered outcomes.
